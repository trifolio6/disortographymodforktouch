# disortographymodforktouch is a moddification for the ktouch to add one cursor rabbit to help users to improve the ortography.
This is not the actual Ktouch. It is based on the sources of https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=ktouch.git and it has the same license.

The authors of this moddifications publish this code to contribute to the Ktouch project.  The code is now one yeard old but we hope it can still be usefull for the main developers even if we used qt4. (Today Ktouch uses Qt5)

The compilation sequence is the same detailled in the README.

We want to express our deep gratitude to the Ktouch developers and the KDE project.
