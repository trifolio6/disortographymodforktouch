KTouch is a program to learn and practice touch typing. Every finger
has its place on the keyboard with associated keys to press. Starting
with only a few keys to remember you will advance through different
training levels where additional keys are introduced. Because you no
longer need to search for the keys on the keyboard you will be able
to type quickly and accurately.
